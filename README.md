# Cookie-Data-Analysis
This project explores the science behind the sweetness using an open-source dataset of chocolate chip cookie recipes. By analyzing ingredient ratios with respect to flour, I uncover patterns among top-rated cookies — from butter-to-flour ratios for richness, to the magic balance of vanilla and salt for flavor depth.

# Objective:
To identify optimal ingredient ratios (standardized by flour) that are most commonly associated with highly rated cookie recipes, and use these insights to build a foolproof recipe framework.

What’s Inside:
	•	Data cleaning and preprocessing
	•	Visual analysis of ingredient trends
	•	Ratio vs. rating insights for key cookie elements like:
	•	Richness (butter)
	•	Sweetness (white & brown sugar)
	•	Structure (eggs)
	•	Chocolate density (choco chips)
	•	Rise & spread (baking soda)
	•	Flavor depth (vanilla & salt)
	•	A final recipe framework, backed by data and baking logic

# The Outcome:

A simple, well-balanced cookie recipe built on numbers and tested traditions — perfect for bakers and data nerds alike.
